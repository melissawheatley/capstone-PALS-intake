# PALS Lead Generation Form and Case Management Portal

## About the PALS Portal
*Post Adoption Learning Services (PALS) supports the unique learning needs of children adopted internationally. Founded in 2016, PALS works to provide direct services, training, education advocacy, and other activities for children and families.*

The PALS portal is a lead generation form paired with and a digital intake/case management system. The goal of the portal is to encourage parents of children adopted internationally to explore resources provided by Post Adoption Learning Services, and thereby empower PALS staff to serve these clients more efficiently and elegantly. 

## Project Discovery Process — User Research & Personas
I interviewed Anna, PALS Executive Director, to understand her needs and the needed areas on an intake form. I also built a survey for adoptive parents of children with special needs that was used to compile a user persona for “Jennifer Capstone.” 

Through the end-user survey, I discovered that families who would benefit for PALS' advocacy services may be hesitant to seeking help and will need more information before deciding to work with Anna. This led to refinement of my feature requirements and the creation of the lead generation form on top of the case management piece. Further testing showed that shifting even more data collection fields away from the first form created a better experience. 

[Additional research methods and persona information are available in this presentation.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1p1m-na8QRiZQBMoi5Auc2FzR2mprOe6oW-gxSVBWK2w/edit?usp=sharing)

## Key Features
The PALS portal is a single-page CRUD application. It was coded to include the following features:

*Simple and intuitive interface for increasingly complex forms.
*Lead generation form values are saved to Firebase.
*Users will receive a customized response based on submitted lead gen for values.
*Users may log in with Google authentication to save their personal case file.
*Users may edit and delete their case files. 
*The client has the "admin" ability to view all user profiles.

**Features that are currently or soon to be in development include:**

*Creating functionality to allow login by username/password with test credentials for both user and admin view
*Allowing individual users to view more than one child profile

*Additional Features have been considered, but were not within the original scope of this project. Additional features will be added to the public queue as additional development time can be allocated.*
